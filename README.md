# dsm-to-3-band

This is a python script to convert DSM (single band) file to 3-banded (RGB banded) Gtiff file.
Other `.sh` files are just a helper script to use docker conveniently, and important thing is `main.py`.

You can run this script with two command line arguments, first one is for input tif, i.e., DSM file, and second one is for output tif, i.e., 3-banded Gtiff file.
